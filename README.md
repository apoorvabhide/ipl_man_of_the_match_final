This is a classification practice.
The basic problem I'm trying to solve is this:
  The match is done. Both innings are done, we know the result and how each batsman and bowler did.
  Based on that, can I predict who the man of the match is going to be?

Dataset is the IPL dataset on Kaggle. Data included is till 2017.
The script contains all the processing I've done on the data and the model.
An Rmd with a detailed explanation is on its way.
